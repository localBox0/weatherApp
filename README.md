# React Weather App

### This application is a weather web application developed using React that allows users to view current weather and forecast for any location in the world.

The technology stack used to develop this application includes the following technologies:

- React
- Typescript
- Sass for styles

-- An asynchronous React-select-async-paginate form has been added, and integration with the Geo-RapidAPI has been implemented to obtain the coordinates of the selected city.

-- The current weather forecast is obtained by coordinates using the OpenWeatherMap API, and the weather forecast for 7 days is obtained using the Open-Meteo API.

-- Variables have been added for color schemes and behavior patterns, and the ability to change the color theme while maintaining the state has been implemented.

-- The current coordinates can be obtained from the browser using navigator.geolocation. An alert has been added asking for permission to access the location or to choose a different city if access to the current location is not granted.

-- Initial adaptation for mobile devices has been implemented.
